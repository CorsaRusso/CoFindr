# CoFindr
## Inspiration
A factor of entrepreneurship is finding the right people to execute an idea with; however, it might be hard to meet the person that perfectly complements one's skillset and vision. Furthermore, there is an element of randomness towards meeting the right people. CoFindr aims to eliminate the randomness of finding the ideal cofounder for your startup.

## What it does
CoFindr matches potential cofounders together using a gamified swipe system.

## How we built it
First, we used Figma to create a draft of what we wanted the application to look like, then we moved this model into react.js. We adapted existing swipe-based code from react.js and modified it so it would be more suitable for our needs as a networking application. We researched aspects of an application that allow users to interact with it effectively, and factors that make a business scalable without extra cost.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Figma
